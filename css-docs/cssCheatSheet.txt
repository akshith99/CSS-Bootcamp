Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element
element element            // All the descendants of the first element get the style
element > element         // Only the direct child of the first element will get the style
element + element        // Adjacent sibling of the first element will get the style
element ~ element       //  General sibling of the first element will get the style
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
